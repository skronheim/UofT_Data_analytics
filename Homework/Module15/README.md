## Purpose

This code is written in JavaScript for use with D3 and Leaflet to fulfill the Module 15 Challenge homework assignment in the UofT data analytics course. 

More generally, this code is used to set up and run an html to show a map of the last 7 days worth of earthquakes and tectonic plate lines. For the earthquakes, circles center around the location of each quake, with radii corresponding to the magnitude of the quake and color corresponding to the depth. Popups show the location, magnitude, and depth of each quake and are shown upon click.  

Three different base tile layers are available and can be toggled using the control in the top right corner. The earthquake and tectonic plate data can also be toggled on and off using the control panel. 

## Instructions 

Run the index.html file in a browser to view and interact with the map. 

The code is in the static/js/logic.js file.
