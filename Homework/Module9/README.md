## Purpose

This code is written in postgresql for use with pgAdmin 4 to fulfill the Module 9 Challenge homework assignment in the UofT data analytics course. 

More generally, this code is used to design, set up, and query a database with employee information. 

## Assumptions and Requirements 

Postgresql and pgAdmin 4 are required to run this code. 

When importing data into database tables, headers are assumed to be present.

## Instructions 

The ERD is saved as 'ERD.png' and can be viewed by any image viewer. 

To set up the database, open the 'table_schema.sql' file in pgAdmin 4 and run it. Then import the data into each table from the provided csv files. The names of the tables align roughly with the names of the csv files.

To run the queries, open the 'queries.sql' file in pgAdmin 4 and run each query individually. The queries are separated by semicolons, as well as lines of comment to describe what each query outputs.
