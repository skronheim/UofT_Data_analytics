## Purpose

This code is written in Python for use with MongoDB, pymongo, and Pandas to fulfill the Module 11 Challenge homework assignment in the UofT data analytics course. 

More generally, this code is used to set up a NoSQL database in MongoDB and make queries of the database to analyze the data. 

## Assumptions and Requirements 

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, MongoDB, mongoimport, and mongosh are required to run this code. 

mongoimport, mongosh, and mongod must also be in your PATH to run this code.

## Instructions 

To set up and query the database, start a MongoDB instance in a terminal. Next, import the establishments.json file from the Resources folder by navigating to the Resources folder in a new terminal and pasting the command written in the first Markdown cell in the NoSQL_setup.ipynb file into the terminal. 

To run the analyses, keep the database going and run each Python cell in both the NoSQL_setup.ipynb file and the NoSQL_analysis.ipynb file.
